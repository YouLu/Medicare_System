Medicare_System
===============

This is my undergraduate senior project.

The framework includes UI layer, client proxy layer, web service layer, application layer, business layer, DAO layer, 
and entity layer. UI layer allows developers to design user interfaces in configuration file. Client proxy layer and 
web service layer ensure effective and secure data exchange. Application layer and business layer use the reflection 
concept and XML file to provide a pool to manage all the objects. DAO layer provides a pure object-oriented 
programming experience to deal with SQL. Developers donâ€™t need to write any SQL sentence to communicate with database;
instead, they can simply call the functions that the framework provides. Entity layer provides O/R mapping 
functionality, which allows automatically converting from database tables to C# classes.
The framework also includes exception handling and log functionality.
